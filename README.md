## Problem Statement

In the healthcare industry, patients receive medical care from multiple healthcare providers and may be covered by different insurance providers. This can lead to fragmented medical records, resulting in suboptimal patient care and insurance decisions.

To address this challenge, a solution is required that provides a centralized database for storing and tracking the patient's complete medical history. The solution should be implemented using Spring Boot and provide a REST API that allows healthcare providers, insurance providers, and patients to access and manage the patient's medical records.

The solution should incorporate auditing capabilities using Spring Data Envers, which will enable tracking of all changes made to the patient's health records, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the records. The solution should also implement role-based access control to ensure that only authorized users can access the patient's health records.

Healthcare providers can use the solution to provide better medical care to patients by having access to the patient's complete medical history. Insurance providers can make more informed decisions on coverage and claims by having access to the patient's health records. Patients can view, update, and share their health records with healthcare providers and insurance providers, leading to more effective medical care and better insurance decisions.

By implementing this solution, the healthcare industry will have a centralized and secure system for managing patient health records, resulting in improved patient care and better insurance decisions.
